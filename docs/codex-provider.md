# Codex Subscription Provider

Use an existing ChatGPT subscription through a locally installed Codex CLI.
No OpenAI API key is used, and failures do not fall back to another provider.

1. Install Codex CLI and run `codex login` as the user running claude-mem.
2. Run `npx claude-mem install --provider codex` (optionally add `--model gpt-6-luna`), or select Codex in the viewer, or set `CLAUDE_MEM_PROVIDER` to `codex` in `settings.json`.
3. Restart the claude-mem worker.

If `--model` is omitted, the installer keeps any saved Codex model. On a first
install the model setting is empty, so Codex chooses its default. To return to
that default after choosing a model, clear the Codex Model field in the viewer
or set `CLAUDE_MEM_CODEX_MODEL` to an empty string in `settings.json`.

Optional settings:

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_CODEX_MODEL` | empty | Use Codex's default model, or name a model available to your subscription. |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT` | `low` | Reasoning effort. Override in `settings.json` or the environment when the selected model supports a different effort. |
| `CLAUDE_MEM_CODEX_PATH` | `codex` | CLI executable, resolved through PATH unless an explicit path is supplied. Set it in `settings.json` or the environment; the settings API does not accept executable paths. |

Each request uses the observer's shared deadline, `CLAUDE_MEM_LLM_TIMEOUT_MS`
(180 seconds by default); oversized-field condensation uses
`CLAUDE_MEM_FIELD_OPTIMIZE_TIMEOUT_MS`, as it does for every provider.

The provider uses `codex app-server` over stdio. It reuses claude-mem's existing
observation, summary, payload compression and persistence workflow. Requests
use ephemeral threads in a private workspace with tools, MCP servers, hooks
and project instructions disabled. The CLI manages subscription authentication;
claude-mem does not store credentials in its own settings.

File-backed ChatGPT login in `CODEX_HOME/auth.json` (or `~/.codex/auth.json`) is
required. On Unix, the auth file must be owned by the worker user and private
to that user. API-key login is rejected. Use a Codex CLI version that supports
app-server ephemeral threads and instruction-source attestation; unsupported
protocol responses fail rather than silently relaxing isolation.

Failures are handled like every other observer provider's, and buffered work is
kept for the next attempt:

- A spent usage limit or a refused login pauses Codex requests behind the
  provider breaker; one request re-probes every 30 minutes, and a served
  request clears it. A request already waiting for the app-server is withheld
  while the breaker is armed instead of earning the same refusal.
- A missing CLI or ChatGPT login (or an auth file other users can read) is
  reported as `codex_cli` setup in `/api/health`; Codex starts wait 5 minutes
  between recovery probes.
- Timeouts and connection faults resume on the observer's transport backoff.

When testing from source, build the worker with `node scripts/build-hooks.js`
before starting it. The installer requires a release that includes the Codex
worker bundle.

### Concurrent requests

`CLAUDE_MEM_CODEX_MAX_CONCURRENT_AGENTS` defaults to `2` (integer 1-8; invalid values use 2). Set it in settings.json; the settings API does not expose this key. Restart the worker after changing it. Requests enter a FIFO pool of exclusive app-server clients, each with its own private workspace and process. Queued cancellation does not send a request; shutdown cancels work and closes every client. Quota/setup admission is checked immediately before sending, and failures publish cooldowns before the slot is reused. Already admitted concurrent requests may still finish after a quota failure.

### Observation backlog batching

Codex immediately combines up to `CLAUDE_MEM_CODEX_OBSERVATION_BATCH_SIZE=8` observations (integer 1-32). The rendered observation turn is capped by `CLAUDE_MEM_CODEX_OBSERVATION_BATCH_MAX_CHARS=32000` (integer 4000-128000); invalid settings use defaults. This budget excludes prior conversation history. There is no wait to fill a batch. FIFO summaries, prompt numbers, working directories, and agent attribution changes stop a batch. Each input retains its timestamp, tool fields, tool-use ID and pending ID. Oversized next items run separately through existing field compression; an oversized first item uses explicit field elision after compression to respect the cap (if even its metadata does not fit, both fields are elided).

Only included items are claimed, and the existing response/storage path acknowledges them after an accepted response (including an explicit `<skip_summary />`). A reply that is neither XML nor the skip sentinel asks for the whole batch once more, like any provider's. Quota and transport pauses, aborts and conversation recycling retain buffered work. Other providers keep single-observation requests. The queue remains in RAM: process crashes still require transcript replay.
