/**
 * #2756 round-2 review finding (important) — `tryAdmitQuotaProbe`/
 * `recordQuotaExhausted`/`releaseQuotaProbe` all read and write ONE
 * module-level `cooldowns` Map in src/shared/quota-cooldown.ts, exactly the
 * same "shared real singleton across every file in one `bun test` process"
 * shape that tests/supervisor/process-registry-singleton-guard.ts exists to
 * catch for the process registry. `SessionRoutes.admitAndStartGenerator`
 * (this PR's own refactor) calls `tryAdmitQuotaProbe` FOR REAL — unmocked —
 * on every fresh-start and parked-provider-switch path, so any test file
 * that drives `ensureGeneratorRunning` for real (this PR's
 * session-routes-provider-switch.test.ts) shares this singleton with every
 * other file in the same run that arms or claims it
 * (tests/worker/quota-cooldown.test.ts, tests/worker/overflow-recycle-resume.test.ts,
 * and any future file). A cooldown left armed, or a probe claim left
 * outstanding, by one of those files would silently gate every generator
 * start in this file for the rest of the process instead of failing loudly.
 *
 * Call this once at the file's TRUE TOP LEVEL — outside every describe() —
 * for the same LIFO-afterEach-ordering reason documented on
 * guardSharedProcessRegistrySingleton (process-registry-singleton-guard.ts):
 * only a hook registered outside every describe() block is guaranteed to run
 * its "after" check strictly after that file's own local cleanup, which must
 * stay nested one level in.
 *
 * The cmem gateway re-probe claim (provider-dispatch.ts) lives in the same Map
 * under 'cmem-gateway', so the check below covers it too: a claim left held by
 * one test routes every later gateway dispatch in the process to 'claude'.
