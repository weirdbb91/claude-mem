Search past work across all sessions. Follow this workflow: search -> filter -> fetch.

## When to Use

Use when users ask about PREVIOUS sessions (not the current conversation):

- "Did we already fix this?"
- "How did we solve X last time?"
- "What happened last week?"

## 3-Layer Workflow (ALWAYS Follow)

NEVER fetch full details without filtering first. This saves 10x tokens.

### Step 1: Search — get an index with ids

Use the \`mem_search\` tool with a free-text query. It returns ids, titles, and types.
Omit \`platformSource\` to search ALL memory; set it only to restrict to your own platform's memory.

### Step 2: Filter — narrow to the interesting ids

Pick the candidate ids from the index results that look relevant to the question.

### Step 3: Fetch — get full details only for the filtered ids

Use \`mem_get_observations\` with the selected ids. Use \`mem_timeline\` to get context
around a specific observation by id.

For the worker's own session-start context text, use \`mem_context\`.
