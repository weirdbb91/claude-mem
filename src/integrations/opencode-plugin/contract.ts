/**
 * OpenCode plugin event contract.
 *
 * These constants and helpers describe the contract between claude-mem's
 * OpenCode plugin and OpenCode's host API. They live OUTSIDE the plugin entry
 * module (`index.ts`) on purpose: OpenCode's plugin loader imports the entry
 * module and treats EVERY export as a plugin factory, requiring each one to
 * be a function (non-function exports fail the load with
 * "Plugin export is not a function", and even extra function exports would be
 * invoked as plugins). Data exports and pure helpers must therefore live in
 * their own module; the entry module exports only the plugin factory
 * (#3330).

/**
 * OpenCode plugin event contract.
 *
 * A plugin is an async function that receives a context object and returns an
 * object whose keys are OpenCode's real hook names. The hooks claude-mem binds
 * to are (authoritative source: plans/08-opencode-integration.md "Fix sequence"
 * step 1, cross-checked against OpenCode's documented plugin API):
 *
 *   - `tool.execute.after`            (input, output) — fires after every tool run
 *   - `chat.message`                  ({}, output)    — fires on each chat message
 *   - `event`                         ({ event })     — generic bus; event.type carries the name
 *   - `experimental.session.compacting`               — fires when a session compacts
 *   - `experimental.chat.system.transform` (input, { system }) — builds each request's
 *                                                       system prompt; memory context is pushed here
 *
 * The generic `event` hook delivers bus events whose discriminant is
 * `event.type`. The only bus event types claude-mem reacts to are
 * `session.deleted` (forget the session mapping) and `session.idle` (best-effort
 * summarize). Session creation/observation capture is driven by the dedicated
 * `tool.execute.after` / `chat.message` hooks above, not by bus events — that is
 * the #2435 fix: the old code subscribed to non-existent bus types
 * (`session.created`, `message.updated`, `session.compacted`, `file.edited`)
 * and therefore captured nothing.
 *
 * REAL_OPENCODE_EVENT_TYPES is the allowlist of bus `event.type` values the
 * plugin is permitted to switch on. The contract test asserts the plugin only
 * references names in this list so a future typo fails CI.
