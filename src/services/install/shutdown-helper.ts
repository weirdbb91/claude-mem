/**
 * Why a stop did not complete, so callers can name the fix:
 * - `worker-still-running`: the worker this stop targeted is demonstrably
 *   still alive after the wait. Either the PID file's owner is alive and still
 *   verified (PID plus start token), and then `pid` is set and safe to tell
 *   the user to end; or, with no PID file, the same process answers the
 *   worker's /api/health before the stop and at the deadline, and then `pid`
 *   is null: an HTTP answer does not verify a PID (it may be a container's).
 * - `port-rebound`: the worker this stop targeted has exited, yet the port
 *   still accepts connections: a hook's lazy spawn or a process manager bound
 *   it again, or a leftover process still holds the socket. That is not a stop
 *   that failed. `ownerPid` is the verified PID-file owner now on the port,
 *   when there is one.
 * - `port-held-by-other-process`: something accepts connections on the port,
 *   but no live claude-mem worker owns it and it never accepted a shutdown.

/**
 * Stop the claude-mem worker on `port` and wait until it is gone.
 *
 * Liveness comes from the ownership record (the worker PID file plus its start
 * token, plan-15), not from network error classes: HTTP timeouts, resets and
 * dropped SYNs are ambiguous, and on WSL2 mirrored networking a refused
 * loopback connect can arrive slowly or not at all (#4107). So:
 * - an explicit refusal, however slow, means nothing listens: stopped;
 * - an owned, live worker is running until its process exits;
 * - with no owned worker, only a completed TCP connect counts as a listener.
 *
 * The stop targets the worker that answers on the port when it begins: the
 * PID file's verified owner, or, with no PID file, the process that answers
 * /api/health. Only that worker, still alive at the deadline, is a worker that
 * did not stop. Once it has exited, a port that answers again belongs to a new
 * process (a hook's lazy spawn, a process manager restarting it, a leftover
 * socket), so the result is `port-rebound`. No PID that has not been verified
 * is ever reported: on Windows a dead worker's PID is soon reused.
