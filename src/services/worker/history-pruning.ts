// Bounded observer history for the OpenAI-compatible providers.
//
// Those providers own `session.conversationHistory` and re-send the whole
// array on every query() call. Each observation turn appends a user message
// carrying the full tool payload (up to ~32k chars of <parameters> +
// <outcome>), so a session with N tool uses re-transmits every prior payload
// on every subsequent turn: O(N^2) input tokens on per-token billing, and the
// request eventually crosses the model's context window, which the error
// classifiers treat as unrecoverable.
//
// The raw payload is only needed for the single turn that converts it into
// <observation> blocks. After processAgentResponse() persists those blocks to
// SQLite, the payload is dead weight: the assistant messages already in the
// history ARE the compressed record of that work, and the Claude Code
// transcript remains the durable source of truth for replay. So once an
// exchange falls out of the recent window we replace the payload body with a
// small stub that preserves the message's role, position, tool name, and
// timestamp — chronology and role alternation stay intact, the observer keeps
// reading its own observations for continuity, and per-request input becomes
// bounded instead of growing without limit.
