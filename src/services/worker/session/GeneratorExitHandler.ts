/**
 * Post-generator-exit handler.

 * The generator's message iterator only ends on abort (idle / shutdown) or when
 * the SDK stream throws, so most exits mean this session is done. Quota exits
 * are different: claimed work has already been reset to pending, so leave the
 * session and in-RAM buffer alive for a later generator start.
 *
 * For non-quota exits we do NOT respawn on remaining buffered work: the old
 * respawn-on-pending loop, driven by the durable pending_messages queue, was the
 * retry storm. Buffered work lives only in RAM now; anything still buffered is
 * dropped here and recovered, if needed, by replaying the Claude Code
 * transcript. Continuation of a session that is still live happens naturally —
 * the next observation ingest calls ensureGeneratorRunning, which starts a
 * fresh generator that drains whatever is buffered.
 *
 * Two bounded exceptions, neither of them a retry loop (#3419, plan-21):
 *  - an idle exit that finds work buffered: the idle timeout only fires after
 *    the queue sat empty, so that work arrived while the generator was
 *    stopping — typically the turn's summarize, whose own start request found
 *    the old generator still in place. It is new work, handed to a fresh
 *    generator instead of being disposed of with the buffer;
 *  - an unclassified failure with a summarize buffered: the summary is the
 *    session's last and most valuable event, so it gets one rescue pass per
 *    session before the session finalizes.

  // start a fresh generator for the newly-selected provider on this same

  // in-RAM buffer (SessionManager.removeSessionImmediate -> buffer.dispose),
  // wiping the very queue the switch is meant to preserve. The transcript is
