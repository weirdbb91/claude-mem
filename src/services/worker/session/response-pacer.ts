 * conversationHistory in one burst, so the generation budget tripped on the sum
 * of UNANSWERED prompts, the recycle aborted the in-flight answer, the same
 * oldest batch went back to pending, and the session looped with zero progress.
 *
 * The feed waits on this gate after every prompt it yields, and ClaudeProvider
 * opens it once per finished turn. Waiting happens before the next pull from the
 * message iterator, so nothing is claimed while a prompt is still unanswered.
