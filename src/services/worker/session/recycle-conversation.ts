/**
 * Retire a full observer conversation and start a fresh generation (#3800).
 *
 * Two paths reach here:
 *  - proactive: the generation has spent its character budget, checked BEFORE
 *    a send, so the request that would cross the ceiling is never paid for;
 *  - reactive: the provider refused a request as too long, which is the safety
 *    net for models whose window is narrower than the budget assumes.
 *
 * Both do the same thing, because the conversation is not the memory. The
 * claimed batch goes back to pending, the outgrown conversation is dropped, and
 * the next captured tool call opens a fresh generation seeded with the
 * session's own observations. No turn is "trimmed" and no gap is invented:
 * continuity rides on the observations claude-mem has already written.
