/**
 * The one provider-dispatch rule, shared by SessionRoutes (generator start)
 * and worker-service (getAiStatus) — previously duplicated in both.
 *
 * Semantics: openrouter wins when selected AND a key exists; else gemini when
 * selected AND a key exists; else openai-compatible when selected AND fully
 * configured; else claude (silent fall-through, unchanged).
 *
 * Trial-expiry fallback (plan 2026-08-26 Phase 6): when the selected
 * openrouter config points at the cmem.ai gateway AND a terminal gateway
 * rejection has been recorded (CLAUDE_MEM_PRO_FALLBACK_AT non-empty), dispatch
 * returns 'claude' during a cooldown — memory runs on the user's Anthropic
 * plan, as the installer promised. It then permits a periodic gateway probe
 * so subscribing can recover automatically. User-owned openrouter.ai (or any
 * non-gateway) base URLs ignore the fallback marker entirely.
 *
 * Quota fallback (CLAUDE_MEM_QUOTA_FALLBACK_PROVIDER, opt-in): while the
 * selected provider's breaker holds for its quota (a spent allowance, or a
 * rate limit that outlasted its retries), every plain return is routed to the
 * configured fallback, provided it can serve and is not itself held. Empty —
 * the default — leaves dispatch exactly as it was. The cmem-gateway branch
 * keeps its own marker and runs first, untouched.
