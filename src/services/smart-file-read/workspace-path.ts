 * with no containment check, so an MCP call could read ~/.ssh/id_rsa (and any
 * other file the OS user can read). path.resolve() is lexical only — it does
 * not follow symlinks — so both sides are realpath'd before the comparison.
 * Missing targets fall back to the lexical path so the caller still gets a
 * natural ENOENT, but only after the lexical path itself is known not to escape.
