 * is an envelope that fronts a dead socket and a refused request identically,
 * so it needs a network condition before it counts at all, while `fetch|network

 * an API envelope does not depend on this path — the status patterns below
 * catch it whatever its prose looks like.
 *
 * This errs towards missing: "Network error: the endpoint is behind a firewall"
 * is a real failure it rejects. That is the direction the whole detector errs
