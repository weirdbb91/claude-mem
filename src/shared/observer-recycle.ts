/**
 * Observer conversation generations (#3800).
 *
 * The observer keeps one long-lived conversation per session and appends every
 * captured tool call to it. Nothing bounded it, so a busy session grew that
 * conversation until the provider refused it with "Prompt is too long" — and
 * because the refusal was never classified, every later tool call re-sent an
 * over-ceiling prompt that could not succeed.
 *
 * The fix is NOT to trim the transcript. claude-mem already has a compressed
 * representation of a session: the observations it has been writing all along.
 * So the conversation runs in bounded *generations* — when one approaches the
 * ceiling it is retired and a fresh one starts, seeded with the session's own
 * observations (see buildSessionSoFar in sdk/prompts.ts). Continuity is carried
 * by the memory the product exists to produce, not by raw turns.
 *
 * This module owns only the "is this generation full?" decision.
