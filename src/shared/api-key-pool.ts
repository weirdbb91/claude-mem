/**
 * Multi-key rotation for the OpenAI-compatible providers.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. Every provider resolves exactly one API key, and no classified
 * failure re-decides it. A free-tier Gemini or OpenRouter key has a daily
 * allowance measured in a few hundred requests; an ordinary day of capture
 * spends it before evening. What happens then is not a slowdown but a stop:
 * `rate_limit` is retried two more times against the SAME exhausted key
 * (honoring a `retryAfterMs` that is 60s by default, so the session stalls a
 * full minute per observation before failing anyway), and
 * `quota_exhausted` / `auth_invalid` are not retryable at all — they throw
 * straight out of `withRetry`, the generator exits, and the quota breaker
 * (#3634) arms the whole provider shut for 30 minutes.
 *
 * Users answer this today by keeping several free keys and editing
 * settings.json when one dies. That is the loop this module closes.
 *
 * THE SHAPE. A pool is an ordered list of keys for one provider. A key that
 * earns a `rate_limit`, `quota_exhausted`, or `auth_invalid` is put in
 * cooldown for a kind-specific window, and the next request picks the first
 * key not in cooldown. Rotation happens OUTSIDE `withRetry`, wrapping it: the
 * inner retry still handles transient failures against one key, and this outer
 * loop moves to the next key on the three kinds that mean "this key, not this
 * request, is the problem". A success clears that key's cooldown immediately.
 *
 * WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE. A pool of one key is a pass-through: `withKeyPool`
 * runs the body once and records nothing, so single-key installs — which is
 * every install today — keep byte-identical behavior, including which error
 * escapes and when the quota breaker arms. Cross-provider dispatch
 * (`provider-dispatch.ts`) is untouched; this rotates keys within the provider
 * the user selected, and hands the last classified error back unchanged when
 * every key is spent, so the existing pause/breaker paths still see what they
 * expect.
 *
 * PERSISTENCE. The cooldown windows are written beside `quota-cooldown.json`
 * and hydrated once per process, for the reason that module's docblock already
 * argues at length: an in-memory-only window is cleared by every restart, and
 * a crash-respawn loop would rediscover each dead key once per restart —
 * exactly the storm the quota breaker exists to prevent, relocated one level
 * down.
 *
 * Keys are NEVER written to disk or to a log line, not even truncated. The
 * cooldown file is keyed by a salted-per-file fingerprint, and every log line
 * carries the pool index plus that fingerprint. The fingerprint is stable
 * within an install (so a window survives a restart) and useless outside it.
