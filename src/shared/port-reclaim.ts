/**
 * Port reclaim for the two spawn launchers.
 *
 * TWO distinct failure modes reclaim the worker port here:
 *
 *   1. A WEDGED worker we own (all platforms) — reclaimWedgedOwnedWorker. Our
 *      PID file names a LIVE process that holds the port, but it has stopped
 *      answering /health (e.g. a worker spinning at 100% CPU during a provider
 *      quota cooldown, #4127). It ignores SIGTERM and never yields the port, so
 *      every launcher gives up and the machine hard-blocks. This case is not
 *      Windows-specific and the owner is alive, so the ghost-listener logic
 *      below never sees it — it is handled first, before the Windows gate.
 *      It kills only on evidence: the worker is past its boot grace, fails two
 *      spaced health re-probes, owns the LISTEN socket, still carries the start
 *      token our PID file recorded, and its command line is a claude-mem worker.
 *      This is a backstop; an in-process wedge watchdog is the root fix.
 *
 *   2. A GHOST listener (Windows only) — the rest of this module. Detailed
 *      below.
 *
 * Ghost-listener reclaim on Windows.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — the 2026-09-07 reproduction (and #3482 / #3300 / plan-15
 * #3603): the worker daemon's listening socket is inherited by the chroma-mcp
 * sidecar tree (uvx -> uv -> python) it spawns. When the worker is killed
 * OUT-OF-BAND — crash, `taskkill /F` without `/T`, a kill that runs no
 * shutdown code — nothing tree-kills the sidecar, so the descendants stay
 * alive holding the inherited socket handle. Windows keeps the port LISTENING
 * under the DEAD worker's PID (netstat shows an owner that no longer exists),
 * and every launcher treats "port in use" as proof of a live worker:
 *
 *   - the daemon duplicate gate logs "Port already in use, refusing to start
 *     duplicate" and exit(0)s;
 *   - ensureWorkerStarted() logs "Port in use but worker not responding to
 *     health checks" and returns 'dead'.
 *
 * Neither ever reclaims, so the port stays bound until a human tree-kills the
 * chroma chain by hand (the recovery manual). This module automates that
 * recovery with the same evidence the manual uses:
 *
 *   1. netstat finds the LISTENING owner PID(s) for the port;
 *   2. if EVERY owner is dead, the surviving sidecar is located two ways:
 *      a. walking down the process table's parent chain from the dead PID
 *         (Windows preserves the parent link after the parent exits);
 *      b. a full-table scan for processes whose command line points at THIS
 *         install's chroma store (`--data-dir <DATA_DIR>`), which catches the
 *         broken-chain case: when the worker dies, its uvx/uv stdio parents
 *         read EOF and exit, leaving the chroma-mcp/python sidecar orphaned
 *         one or two links BELOW a dead PID — unreachable by walk (a), but
 *         still carrying our data-dir argument;
 *   3. only processes that are chroma sidecars by executable name (walk a)
 *      or by data-dir fingerprint (scan b) are killed, so a reused PID whose
 *      new owner happens to have children cannot pull unrelated processes
 *      into the kill;
 *   4. every kill goes through killProcessTree with the start token from the
 *      SAME table read that discovered the target, so a PID that exits and is
 *      reissued between discovery and kill is never signalled.
 *
 * A live owner the ghost path finds — a foreign service, another install, or
 * a worker the wedged path above declined — is never touched: those keep the
 * current "in use" behavior, not get killed by a launcher.

 *   3. Identity: the PID is a LISTEN owner of this port, it still carries the

 *      claude-mem worker (the command-line check comes from quinnmacro's
 *      #3408). That token is handed to killProcessTree, which revalidates it
