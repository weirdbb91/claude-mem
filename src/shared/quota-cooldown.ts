/**
 * Per-provider quota circuit breaker (#3634).
 *
 * When a provider reports the user's inference allowance exhausted, nothing
 * stopped the worker from trying again: the generator exits, and the very next
 * captured tool call runs `ensureGeneratorRunning`, which starts a fresh
 * generator, sends one more request, and earns the same refusal. There is one
 * doomed request per observation, for the rest of the billing cycle — 11 capped
 * users produced tens of thousands of cap events in a single day, roughly a
 * hundred per successful observation.
 *
 * `ensureGeneratorRunning` already has exactly this gate for a missing Claude
 * CLI (`setup_required` + `CLAUDE_CLI_SETUP_RECHECK_COOLDOWN_MS`). This is the
 * same shape for quota, kept separate because quota is per-provider user state
 * rather than a machine-wide dependency.
 *
 * The breaker arms on a quota-exhausted generator exit, expires after a
 * cooldown so a single request can re-probe, and clears immediately on success
 * — so recovery costs at most one cooldown window, not a manual restart.
 *
 * PERSISTENCE, and the deliberate split within it.
 *
 * The armed window is written to disk beside `observer-health.json`, for the
 * reason that file's own docblock already gives: the state must survive worker
 * restarts. An in-memory-only breaker is cleared by every restart — the
 * `/api/admin/restart` endpoint (the process serving it IS the process holding
 * the Map), `npx claude-mem restart`, a reboot, a plugin-version SIGKILL, a
 * crash-and-respawn, and this repo's own documented `npm run build-and-sync`.
 * A crash-restart loop is the worst shape: crash, respawn, empty breaker,
 * doomed request, repeat — the storm again with extra steps.
 *
 * The probe claim (`probeInFlightSinceMs` / `probeClaimId`) is deliberately NOT
 * persisted, and must load as null. It is single-process concurrency state: a
 * restart kills every generator that could be holding one, so a claim restored
 * from disk would be owned by a dead process and would wedge the provider shut
 * until it went stale — the opposite of the failure this breaker prevents.
