/**
 * Shared Claude executable discovery and validation.
 *
 * Used by SDKAgent and KnowledgeAgent to locate a working Claude Code CLI.
 *
 * Every candidate is probed with the CAPABILITY PROBE — `--permission-mode
 * dontAsk --version` — not just `--version`. claude-mem passes
 * `--permission-mode dontAsk` on every Observer/KnowledgeAgent spawn (see
 * buildHardenedSdkOptions in src/sdk/hardened-options.ts), and CLIs older than
 * the 2.1.x line reject it with "argument 'dontAsk' is invalid" and exit 1
 * before doing any work. A binary that answers `--version` but fails the probe
 * would die instantly at SDK spawn time, producing the silent
 * "healthy worker, zero observations" failure mode (#2782 family; previously
 * #1857/#2049 with --setting-sources, #1866, #2142). The probe makes no API
 * call: a capable CLI short-circuits on --version (~150 ms), an incompatible
 * one errors at flag parsing.
 *
 * When several candidates are installed (PATH shadowing, abandoned npm-global
 * installs next to the auto-updating native installer), the NEWEST capable
 * version wins — PATH order is only a tie-breaker.
 *
 * Closes #2222 (desktop-app detection), hardens against stale-CLI selection.
