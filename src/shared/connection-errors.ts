/**
 * The one "is this a refused connection?" check behind every worker-down
 * decision (HealthMonitor shutdown, installer shutdown, `npx claude-mem search`,
 * the OpenCode plugin).
 *
 * A refused connection surfaces differently per runtime, and a
 * `message.includes('ECONNREFUSED')` check misses most of them:
 * - Bun's fetch rejects with `code: 'ConnectionRefused'` and an
 *   "Unable to connect…" message that never mentions ECONNREFUSED.
 * - Node's undici rejects with `TypeError('fetch failed')`; the ECONNREFUSED
 *   code lives only on `error.cause`, and with happy-eyeballs on a nested
 *   AggregateError's `errors`.
 * - Some wrappers keep only Node's message text ("connect ECONNREFUSED …").
 *
 * No imports on purpose: this module is bundled into the hooks and the
 * OpenCode plugin.
