/**
 * Cross-launcher spawn lockfile (Phase 4 of
 * plans/2026-06-10-worker-restart-single-source-of-truth.md).
 *
 * Three independent launchers can try to start the worker at the same time —
 * hooks (src/shared/worker-utils.ts), the MCP server
 * (src/services/worker-spawner.ts), and the CLI restart fallback
 * (src/services/worker-service.ts). This gate gives
 * them mutual exclusion over the SPAWN only: whoever creates
 * `<DATA_DIR>/spawn.lock` with the `wx` flag (O_CREAT|O_EXCL — the create IS
 * the atomicity, no rename or lock library needed) is the one launcher allowed
 * to spawn; everyone else skips their spawn and waits for the winner's worker
 * to come up.
 *
 * Hard rules:
 * - The lock gates SPAWNING only — never health/readiness checks. A held lock
 *   must never make a hook FAIL, only wait for the holder's worker.
 * - Staleness is judged by the lock file's mtime (statSync().mtimeMs), never
 *   by clock values stored in the file content. A lock whose holder PID is
 *   dead is also broken even when mtime is still fresh (claude-mem#3300) —
 *   a dead holder can never open the port, and Windows file indexers can
 *   keep refreshing mtime so the 60s breaker alone never fires.
 * - The dying worker's restart handoff (src/services/worker-shutdown.ts) is
 *   deliberately NOT gated: it is the PRIMARY spawner on restart, and hooks
 *   wait for its successor instead of competing with it.
